### Wiki  

Wikipedia like website. Users can add, edit or get a random wiki entry.  
This was my first project made with Django. This app doesn't use Django models, instead a .md file is created/modified everytime a user  
adds/edits an entry.
The main objective of this project was to get a grasp on the basic concepts of the Django framework.
